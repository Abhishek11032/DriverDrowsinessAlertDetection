# DriverDrowsinessAlertDetection
Built a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Python and OpenCV. Used Haar Cascade algorithm for face and eye detection. Monitored eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect prolonged eye closure. Implemented audio/visual alerts for drowsiness. Optimized for low-latency real-time processing. Scalable for vehicle safety systems.
